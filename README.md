# Intersection-Of-Two-Matrices
Write a program that reads two char matrices (A[][] and B[][]) of the same order M * N and prints the third matrix C[][] which is filled with the intersecting elements of A and B, otherwise set the element to '*'. On the first two lines, you receive M and N, then on 2 * M lines N characters â€“ the matrices elements.
